# DataStruct
Implementations of ADTs, practice on object oriented programming

As an aspired Data Analyst and programmer, I've been practicing my object oriented programming skill using C++ ( a language I'm most experienced with).
Knowing how ADT works is certainly not enough, we need to implement them into codes to have them perform.

Everyone has their own style of implementation; I like to implement them using class objects and features like overloaded assignment operator and copy constructors.
There are so much more to learn and evolve my code, and I'm taking one step at a time to improvise my code as I deepen my knowledge.

Thank you for viewing my codes!
